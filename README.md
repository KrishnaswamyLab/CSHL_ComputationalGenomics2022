# Cold Spring Harbor Course on Computational Genomics 
### November 30 - December 7 2022

**<u>Precourse Recommendations:</u> <br />**
The course workshops will use Python, and some practice beforehand is strongly recommended. For those without Python experience at this point, I would recommend purchasing and going through the [Codecademy Python 3 Tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) (focus on Sections 1-6) and the [Data Analysis with Pandas Tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/data-processing-pandas). These two courses will provide a sufficient background for the course.<br>

I also suggest you get some exposure to some of the mathematical concepts we will teach during the workshop. A great place to start is the following review article from our lab: [Manifold learning-based methods for analyzing single-cell RNA-sequencing data](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coisb.2017.12.008).<br>
A full list of pre-course activites can be found at our lab [website](https://www.krishnaswamylab.org/workshop-materials#pre-course).

**Single-cell preprocessing:**  
The data we will be working with is already pre-processed. To learn how to preprocess scRNA-seq data from publicly available data, see this [Google Colab](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jbyEQEIHXUK8GXCBvGoyZnHLQvsZV7c7?usp=sharing).
